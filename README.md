FiddleCrawler

To run the program you mast install node js and phantomjs first.
I'm assuming you already knew how to install node js and npm, To install phantom js just use 
npm install phantomjs -g (may have to use sudo before the command in ubuntu based distro linux).
To run the program afetr installing phantom js 
 1> just specify the URLs inside the url array of the program.
 2> Then in the terminal hit phantomjs FiddleCrawler.js
 
 PS the jquery is needed for theprogram to run.. Download any version 1.4+ of jQuery named it as as "jquery.js" and place it in a root folder along with FiddleCrawler.js
